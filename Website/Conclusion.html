            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>In order to answer my initial focus question: Would integrating instant messaging into the 
            school environment be beneficial for both students and teachers? I have looked at many important 
            points and have used both local information in the form of a questionnaire and external data to help me draw and 
            accurate conclusions. </p>
            <p>
                The findings indicate that most respondents experienced increased productivity through the use of instant messaging, a result consistent with Ying Tang's research. Instant messaging also promotes a culture of learning, leading to higher student engagement, as evidenced by Figure 2. When students observe their peers participating, they are more inclined to join in, fostering an interactive learning environment. Additionally, the capacity for off-hours discussions and one-on-one interactions with teachers is highly valued by respondents, with 100% agreeing that instant messaging effectively facilitates communication between them and their teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The investigation revealed that instant messaging, when combined with chatbots, offers benefits for both teachers and administrative staff. Teachers can utilize chatbots to address their frequently asked questions efficiently, streamlining their work. Similarly, administrative staff can delegate repetitive tasks like phone answering and email management to chatbots, allowing them to allocate more time to other important responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is for the reasons stated above and those discussed in my analysis and finding that I can answer my focus question: Would integrating instant messaging into the school environment be beneficial for both students and teachers?
                Without a shadow of doubt I can conclude that integrating instant messaging into the school environment would be beneficial for all parties. It can lead to more student engagement amongst students and save time for teachers. Integrating instant messaging into school environment would be beneficial for all.
