                    In my findings I processed various information in order to answer my main focus question.<br/>
                    Would integrating instant messaging into the school environment be beneficial for both students and teachers?<br/>
                    below are 3 arguments or claims that I have drawn from my data in order to answer the aforementioned question.

                    The screenshot above displays a query encompassing individuals who occasionally find school-related 
                    messages disruptive. This data suggests that a considerable portion of respondents do indeed experience 
                    disturbances due to such messages. Nevertheless, it is essential to emphasize that despite these disruptions, 
                    respondents still acknowledge the positive impact of instant messaging on productivity. This observation aligns 
                    with findings from a research article authored by Ying Tang, which produced similar results. Ying Tang's study revealed 
                    that while some students grappled with maintaining a balance between school and personal life, the overall consensus was 
                    that instant messaging proved beneficial by allowing students to work at their own pace while accessing real-time assistance. 
                    In summary, both the query and the research article converge to indicate that employing instant messaging in an educational context enhances productivity.

                    <figcaption>Figure 2: Graph comparing student engagement between students using instant messaging for school and those who are not</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The graph illustrates a comparison of student engagement in two classes: one that incorporated instant messaging into their learning (Class A) and one that 
                    did not (Class B). The data clearly demonstrates that Class A, which utilized instant messaging, exhibited higher levels of student engagement than Class B. 
                    This heightened engagement is attributed to the collaborative aspect of instant messaging, where students are more motivated to participate and complete tasks 
                    when they can interact with peers through messaging platforms, fostering discussion and question-sharing.

                    The image shows a questionnaire response table, with a primary focus on the impact of instant messaging on student-teacher communication. Remarkably, all respondents (100%) agreed that instant messaging enhances this communication. This highlights the potential of alternative communication channels, like instant messaging, to strengthen student-teacher relationships, making it easier for students who may face difficulties seeking help during school hours to receive assistance through this medium.
