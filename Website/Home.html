            <h1>CAT PAT</h1>
            <p> My name is Siyamthanda Phakathi a grade 12 CAT student.<br/>
                I have been tasked to conduct research on the impact of instant messaging in our daily lives.<br/>
                With the use of instant messaging now becoming the norm I have chosen to center my research on<br/>
                the effects of instant messaging in the school environment. <br/>The purpose of this PAT is to gather enough information
                to answer my main question throught this PAT.<br/>Would integrating instant messaging into the school environment be benificial for both students and teachers?
