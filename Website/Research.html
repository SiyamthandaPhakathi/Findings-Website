                    In order to draw accurate conclusions I had to use a variety of different sources.
                    I have used external sources in the form of research articles and websites. I have also used 
                    local sources that i have gathered myself. Below is a summary of all the research conducted
                    and a summary of each type of source used.
                </p>
                
                 <h2>Source 1: The Internet</h2>
                    <p> Using the internet as a source in research about instant messaging in schools is highly 
                        beneficial. It provides access to a wide range of academic resources, enables real-time 
                        data collection, and in a sense fosters global collaboration with experts. This enhances the depth 
                        and breadth of research and contributes to having a more accurate conclusion. Using the internet I was
                        able to get an understanding on what exactly instant messaging is. The use of websites gave me more background information
                        on the topic and also provided solutions to certain issues that may arise with the use of instant messaging.</td>

                <h2>Source 2: Research Articles</h2>
                    <p>
                        The inclusion of research articles as a source in a research project investigating the use of instant messaging in the
                        school environment brings invaluable benefits. These articles are the products of rigorous academic scrutiny, ensuring 
                        that the information they contain is well-researched and peer-reviewed, thereby enhancing the credibility and reliability 
                        of the research project. Moreover, these articles often provide a wealth of empirical data, analysis, and insights from 
                        previous studies, offering a solid foundation for framing hypotheses and designing research methodologies. Additionally, 
                        they contribute to a broader contextual understanding of the subject, enabling me to identify trends, best practices, and 
                        potential gaps in existing knowledge. In essence, research articles serve as an indispensable resource, empowering researchers to build 
                        upon the existing body of knowledge, make informed conclusions, and contribute meaningfully to the field of study concerning instant messaging 
                        in educational settings. Research articles like those done by Ying Tang proved to be invaluable when doing this PAT.

                <h2>Source 3: Survey</h2>
                    <p>                      
                    Incorporating surveys as a source in a research project exploring the use of instant messaging in the school environment offers several distinct advantages. 
                    the survey allowed me to directly gather real-time data from a targeted audience, in my case mainly students, providing valuable 
                    insights into their experiences, preferences, and perceptions regarding instant messaging in educational settings. This primary data source allows for the 
                    collection of quantitative and qualitative information, facilitating a well-rounded analysis and a deeper understanding of the subject. Surveys also offer the 
                    opportunity to identify trends, patterns, and potential challenges that may not be readily apparent from existing literature. By leveraging surveys, I was able to 
                    tailor my investigations to specific research questions, thus enriching the overall quality and relevance of my findings, and ultimately contributing to 
                    more informed decision-making in the school environment.

                        On the next page we will be examaning all the information we were able to gather from these sources and examine any trends that may arise.
